# Project ideas 2017

## Information for students

These ideas were contributed by our developers and users.
They are sometimes vague or incomplete.
If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you may wish to contact the developers and find out more about the particular suggestion you are considering.

Being accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive.
Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential mentors.
Simply copying and pasting an idea from here will not work.
Likewise, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors is unlikely to work out.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on the [Clojure mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/clojure) or the [Clojurians slack](http://clojurians.net).

## Adding a proposal

The preferred way to add a proposal is to submit a pull request with your idea added to this document.
Please add your idea to one of the sections below (create a new section if you like) using the following template:

```markdown
#### Project Title

*Brief explanation:*
A few sentences describing the problem to solve.

*Expected results:*
What should the student be able to produce by the end of the project.
This includes tests and documentation.

*Knowledge prerequisite:*
If a student needs to know something to be able to complete the project, be sure to list it.

*Mentor:*
Add your name if you are a developer who is willing to be a primary or secondary mentor for the project.
```

If you cannot submit the project as a pull request, please submit it to:

* The [#gsoc](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/gsoc/) channel in the [Clojurians slack](http://clojurians.net)
* The [Clojure mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/clojure) using the subject prefix `[GSoC Idea]`.
